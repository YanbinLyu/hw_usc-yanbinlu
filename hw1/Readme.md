For the tommytrojan.cpp, I added an extra getline() to avoid the effect of '\n' left in the first row. 
Also in this file, I added another double int pointer called int** possession to stand for the possessions that the residents of each floor have. 

For the part b of problem 2 in hw1.txt, I remember that someone mentioned that we are only using Terminal, while I found in the lab1 that we use Gitbash for windows. Therefore, I left Gitbash and Terminal as the final answer

In the Palindrome, I got confused about whether the value of prev would trace back when we jumped one recursion circle. By doing gpb, I believed that the value of prev could change back when we return to the previous recursion circles.

In the Hw1q5.cpp, I met the problems of heap and leakage and finally solve them with valgrind.
